        <h2>The story behind SpaceX</h2>
        <p>SpaceX is an American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation services company that was founded by a man named Elon Musk in 2002. His goal was to reduce space transportation costs to enable the colonization of Mars. This
          idea came to life after conceptualizing Mars Oasis in 2001, a project that was going to land a miniature experimental greenhouse on Mars that was going to grow plants.</p>
        <p>He said that “This would be the furthest that life’s ever
          traveled. Since then SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, such as the Starlink satellite constellation, and the Dragon cargo spacecraft. </p>

          than the past. And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”</p>
